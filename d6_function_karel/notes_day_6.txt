Learning Time : 70minutes

Defining and Calling Pythion Function
1. you can find all python built-in function on this link : docs.python.org/3/library/function.html
2. to create own function, first you can start with this keyword def, then the second keyword is your function name
3. examples : def my_function(): this mean is you define your own function
4. my_function() it mean you call your own function

Indentation in python
1. Indentation -> when you create function, every line that comes after the function definition that is indented to be inside the function
2. when you write code outside the function definition (not indented) so the last code not part of function
3. so when you call your function, the last code will not run.
4. if you want to create indentation, use space on your keyboard 
5. in python3 you can mix space and tab when you want to indented your code

While Loops
1. While loops would run when the condition is true
2. For Loops -> one where we're looping through a list of items to do something with each item in the list
3. While Loops -> while the particular condition is true then we go inside the loop and we do something repeatedly.
4. Important things, when you use while loops please define condition to stop the first condition. If you not define the condition so the program would continue running
5. when we use for loop and when we use while loop?
6. for loop is greater when you would to iterate something and you need to do something when each thing in iteration ()
7. while loop if you dont care what a number in a sequence you're in, which item you're iterating through in a list and you just simply want to carry out some sort of functionality many, many times until some sort of condition that you set.
