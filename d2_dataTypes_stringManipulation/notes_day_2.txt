Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings
Learning Time : 50minutes

Basic Data Types
1. Type of data type String, Integer, Boolean, and Float
2. String is character, usually indicated with " "
3. We can get index from string using [], example "Hello"[0] the output is H, because indexes start from 0
4. String can concatenate with other string, it cant concatenate with other data types like String + Integer
5. Integer, if we have larger number like 123,456,789 usually using 123_456_789
6. Float is decimal number
7. Boolean True and False


Type error
1. Len function doesnt working with Integer
2. Type Error would inform you the error part
3. we can prevent type errors and we can see the data type using type() function
4. if we have int type then we want to convert to string, we can use function str()
5. Not just convert integer to string, we can convert string to integer using int()
6. Integer to float float()

Mathematical Operation
1. when we devide int data using (/) the output is float 
2. ** is exponen
3. level of priority or PEMDAS is the order of priority
4. () ** * / + -

Number Manipulation and F string
1. if you using // you would get 2 straight away without having to convert it into an integer
2. you can use /= it means, you can devide previous number on variable with the variable
3. example, if we have score = 0 instead of using this code score = score + 1, we can use score += 1
4. instead of converting all variable into string example, we can use f string
