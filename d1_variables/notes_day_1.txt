Day 1 Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
Learning Time : 20minutes

Print Function
1. Some basic function in programing is Print
2. Print function addressed to show the output
3. If we would print String, please added some quotation marks or double quotes arount the String
4. Print function have method to print new line using \n (backslash N)
5. On Print function we can combine 2 string with concenate function (+)
6. Space are very important in python, commonly space called indent

Input Function
1. Input function allow to user input some Data
2. Input function pretty much identical to the print function, instead of the word print, it's just got the word input. And inside the parentheses,
3. we can add comment on our code, comment usually using #
4. we can put function inside the function, ex. print(input())

Variables
1. Variables addressed to store our data, so we can call our data on other code using Variables
2. Examples in phone book, we usually put phone number like (maul:102131023) it means, 12131023 is maul phone number
3. you can naming your variables whatever you want, but note that it should be consistent and make sure your code is readable in the future
4. Variables should be unique and there are no space
