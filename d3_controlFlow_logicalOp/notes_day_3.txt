Control Flow and Logical Operators
Learning Time : 60minutes

Control Flow with if/else and Conditional Operators
1. the analogy of condition is, if water on the bathtub is greater than 80cm, then we should drain the water
2. if condition: do this else: do this
3. in condition indentation is really important
4. when you write else statement, you should same indentation level as the if statement
5. if you type = it means you assign value to the variable, but if you type == it means you are checking to see if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right

Nested if statements and elif statements
1. if we represent extra condition, you can using nested condition
2. when you represent more than 2 condition use elif condition

Multiple if Statements in Succession
1. the variable bill start from 0, but when the condition meet the condition then the bill will change based on bill condition.
2. if you add some condition like (if you want a photo taken) then the customer will get additional bill

Logical Operator
1. when you want to represent multiple condition in 1 if statements you can run Logical Operators like (and or not)
