Randomisation and Python List
Learning Time : 64minutes

Random Module
1. Randomization is really important when we want to create computer program
2. askpython is google for python programming
3. if you want to use random, first you should import random
4. randint(1,10) would define number from 1 to 10
5. module to split the code up into individual modules where each module is responsible for a different bit of functionality of your program
6. how to create a random decimal number between 0 and 5, cause random.random would return float from 0.00000 - 0.99999 the effective way is multiply with integer

Understanding the Offset and Appending Item to Lists
1. List -> way of organizing and storing data in Python
2. List always start with a open square bracket and closing square bracket
3. List index begin with 0, also you can use negative index [-1]
4. You can replace item on your list by using List[1] = your_item

IndexErrors and Working with Nested Lists
1. one of the most common errors youâ€™ll come across is something called the index out of range error
2. if you have bunch of lists, you can perform len on you list, then you can put negative indexing
3. you can create list by using, list = [list1,list2]
